Implement FizzBuzz Logic: The function should print:
- "Fizz" for multiples of 3
- "Buzz" for multiples of 5
- "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5
- The number itself for other numbers
- Call the Function: Call the function for numbers 1 to 20

### Description of Answer
In this question: 
- Function fizzbuzz(n) is created where the n is the numbers that will be used. 
- with a for loop, all the numbers in the list/range goes through conditions.

## Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering
- Create a List of Mixed Data Types: Create a list that contains a mix of integers, strings, and floats.
- Filter the List: Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the integers from the original list.
- Print the New List: Output the filtered list of integers.

### Description of Answer

A list that contain different types of element is created. 

List comprehension goes through the list with a for loop and add the "integer" types to a new element. 

In addition to the answer, an additional answer is given where the user can input the type and if condition checks for the 
type and do the same action.
