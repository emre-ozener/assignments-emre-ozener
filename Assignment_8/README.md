### Exercises and Brief Explanation

#### 1. Create a *lineplot* showing how **Study Time** varies by **Student Name**. Which student has the highest study time?
- Lineplot is created
- Max Study time is determined
- If there are more than one max study time, the user is informed. 

#### 2. Plot a histogram (*histplot*) of **Grade** and determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.
- Histogram is created
- Max frequency is determined
- If there are more than one max frequency, the user is informed. 

#### 3. Create an ECDF plot (*ecdfplot*) for **Grade**. What is the percentage of students scoring less than 85?
- ECDF is created.
- The percentage of students scoring less than 85 is found. 

#### 4. Create a *stripplot* showing **Grade** distribution for each **Course**. Which course has the most spread in grades?
- Stripplot is created
- Course with most spread is found

#### 5. Create a *swarmplot* to show the relationship between Gender and **Study Time**. Which gender has a higher average study time?
- Swarmplot is created
- Gender with higher average study time is found. 

#### 6. Plot a *pointplot* to show the average **Grade** for each Course. Which course has the highest average grade?
- Pointplot is created
- Class with highest average is found
- If there are more than one max average class, the user is informed.
